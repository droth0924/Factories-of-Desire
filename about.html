        <h1>From the whispering in confessionals to the whisperings on a couch, the act of confession historically has been co-opted by religious and state institutions as a means to assert power and ultimately control over our desires. This libidinal economy functions as an oppressive regime that requires us to renounce our truth or suffer the penalty of societal suppression - you’re existence omitted except under the secrecy of darkness. This institutional violence labels our most intimate self perverse, dissuading us from the pursuits of pleasure and joy of being fully seen within the collective community. Under this oppression our sweat and tears are not to be wasted on the frivolous imaginations of fantasy, our bodies and souls continuously cultivated for the present and future sustenance of our “free market”. Factories of Desire is a social research project that aims to fight against the repression and commodification of our individual desires, fantasies, and pleasures through the collection of individual confessions. This collection of anonymous data becomes a collective mirror through which to find personal validation. To participate, simply call the number listed and leave a voicemail. All calls are subject to being recorded, incoming calls are set to anonymous, and you will never receive a call-back. Thank you for participating :).</h1>
